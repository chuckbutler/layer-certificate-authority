 CFSSL is CloudFlare's PKI/TLS swiss army knife. It is both a command line tool
 and an HTTP API server for signing, verifying, and bundling TLS certificates.
 CFSSL consists of:
  - a set of packages useful for building custom TLS PKI tools
  - the cfssl program, which is the canonical command line utility using the CFSSL packages.
  - the multirootca program, which is a certificate authority server that can use multiple signing keys.
  - the mkbundle program is used to build certificate pool bundles.
  - the cfssljson program, which takes the JSON output from the cfssl and multirootca
    programs and writes certificates, keys, CSRs, and bundles to disk.
